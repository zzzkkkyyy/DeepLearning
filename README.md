# DeepLearning Basic Test
This code is for test while I self-learned CNN by online resorces such as CSDN/GitHub/StackOverflow/...

It based on Fully Connected Network for the purpose of using RGB information to predict target image (sematic segematation, depth, etc).

Future Work (may not updated since it's very basic):

* Change loss result to one float num.
* Improve layer design by using tf.layers, tf.contrib, etc.
* ...
